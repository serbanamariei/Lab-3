# Lab 3 – Fundamentals of the C Language: Conditionals and Loops

This folder includes solved problems from Lab 3 of the "Programming Fundamentals" course.

## Topics Covered

- Logical values and boolean expressions in C (`_Bool`, `stdbool.h`)
- Conditional statements: `if`, `else`, and `switch`
- Looping constructs: `while`, `do...while`, and `for`
- Nested decisions and multiple branches
- Practical examples involving real-world logic and data

## Problems

### Part 1 – Simple Decision and Repetition
- Find the maximum of 3 integers
- Evaluate a piecewise-defined function
- Menu-based calculator using `switch`
- Read and sum `n` integers
- Compute product of an input stream (ending with 0)
- Similar as above but with floating-point numbers

### Part 2 – Intermediate Logic and Time Calculations
- Solve quadratic equations with real coefficients
- Compute duration between two time moments
- Compute end time given start and duration
- Generate temperature conversion tables (F → C and C → F)
- For each input, find the largest perfect square ≤ that number
- Compute GCD using Euclid’s algorithm (via function)

### Part 3 – Triangles and Coordinate Logic
- Determine the quadrant of a point in 2D space
- Identify triangle type based on side lengths
- Find closest number in a stream to a given reference

### Part 4 – Advanced Logic
- Classify numbers as perfect, abundant, or deficient
- Analyze sequences: increasing, decreasing, constant, unordered
- Compute limits of a recursive sequence up to a given precision
- Compute `x^n` efficiently using binary decomposition

## Notes

- **No global variables or arrays are allowed**
- Input is read from keyboard; edge cases are to be considered
- Emphasis on structured programming and control flow
